Title: Fear and loathing in H101

Description: Every marketing expert will surely agree that advertising is all about emotions! Lucky you then to advertise in the 
spot where students come to suffer existential dread whilst waiting to be allowed into H101 to sit gruesome exams. 
Opt for this spot and make sure your ad won't be forgotten (although the memories might be linked to trauma)!

not a single student will even consider peeking inside.
